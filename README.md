# @apifellows - APIs With Love And Coffee

At [apifellows.com](https://www.apifellows.com/) we provide helpful tools, best practices and tutorials on our favourite topic of REST APIs, to be precise: OpenAPI 3.x.x specifications:

- [Online REST API Linter](https://www.apifellows.com/rest-api-linter)
- [REST API Guideilnes](https://www.apifellows.com/rest-api-guidelines)

Everything at @apifellows is an API - so this repository contains, how else could it be, our REST API specifications so you can integrate with us.
